Description: Non-interactive upgrade Debian system
 This script will upgrade running Debian system and email the result: what was
 upgraded, from what version to what and for what period of time. The actual
 upgrade will be done only if all index files will be successfully updated, all
 required packages will be successfully downloaded, and finally only if the
 simulating of upgrade will be finished without errors. All old configuration
 files are preserved and can be compared with new *.dpkg-dist files. The auto
 roll back and health check features allows to get system in old state if
 upgrade or test fails. It is intended to be used as cron job.
